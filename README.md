# Learned Convex Prior Sampling

The experiments in the report can be reproduced in the following scripts:
```
├── notebooks
    ├── learn_wavelet_proximal_on_mnist.ipynb (Section 4.2.1)
    ├── denoising_FashionMNIST_wavelets.ipynb (Section 4.2.2)
```
It should be clear that training the neural network for the proximal map in ```learn_wavelet_proximal_on_mnist.ipynb``` is required for running ```denoising_FashionMNIST_wavelets.ipynb```.
